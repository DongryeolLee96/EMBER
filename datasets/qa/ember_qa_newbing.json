The origin of this nickname is quite interesting. It actually came from a childhood nickname he earned because of his Airedale Terrier dog named Duke. Wayne would walk with his quite large dog to school every day, and befriended a local fireman who dubbed the Terrier \u201cBig Duke,\u201d and over time young Marion was called \u201cLittle Duke\u201d . Wayne grew to prefer the \u201cDuke\u201d name over his own, and it evolved into a lifelong nickname .", "str": "Completely confident", "weak": "I cannot provide a definitive answer"}, {"question": "Who wrote the book 'Elmer Gantry'?", "golden_answer": ["Sinclair Lewis"], "answer_newbing": "The book \u2018Elmer Gantry\u2019 was written by\u00a0Sinclair Lewis.\u00a0It is a satirical novel that presents aspects of the religious activity of the United States in fundamentalist and evangelistic circles and the attitudes of the 1920s public toward it.", "judge_newbing": true, "wiki": ["(Harry) Sinclair Lewis", "Harry Sinclair Lewis", "Lewis, (Harry) Sinclair", "Grace Hegger", "Sinclair Lewis"], "answer_newbing_str": "I am certain the book \u2018Elmer Gantry\u2019 was written by Sinclair Lewis.
